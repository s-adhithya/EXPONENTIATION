# Find the exponentiation of a number

## AIM:
To write a program to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Get the input from the user.
2. Use exponentiation operator to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Program:
```python
Program to find the exponentiation of a number.
Developed by: Adhithya.S
RegisterNumber: 22005823
n1=int(input())
n2=int(input())
result=n1**n2
print("Exponentiation of a given number:",result)
```
## Output:
